This is a synthetic scheme of what I (nicb) understood about the current
(January 2011) FP7 financial guidelines. This scheme is built out  of  a
document downloaded from:

ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/fp7/docs/financialguide_en.pdf

on January 10, 2011. I am a total noob  in  these  things,  so  you  are
welcome to correct and amend this document if you feel that some  things
are missing or if they are plain wrong (or even mildly wrong).

=== COST MODELS ===

(Even though they say that FP7 has *no* cost model (p.61), it turns  out
that if you keep on reading you discover that they  *do*  anyway  (p.62.
sec. 2a and ff.) - just to confuse issues a bit further).

1) ACTUAL INDIRECT COST (AIC) (sec.2a)

   All costs (including indirect costs) are reported as such. As  a  way
   of simplifying things, we introduce the concept of o/h rate which may
   be decided by the partner using AIC (just to make a sensible  preview
   accounting for the proposal).

   In this system:

   - RTD Activities are funded at a max rate of 50%
   - DEMO Activities are funded at a max rate of 50%
   - OTHER Activities are funded at a max rate of 100%

   The o/h are calculated on full *direct costs* as a percentage and then
   funded according to the scheme. Example:

   Partner AIC with 85% o/h rate and RTD funded 50%:

   - RTD direct costs 100 kEuro
   - DEMO direct costs 100 kEuro
   - OTHER direct costs 100 kEuro

   then:

   - RTD + O/H = 185 kEuro => funded => 92.50 kEuro
   - DEMO + O/H = 185 kEuro => funded =>  92.50 kEuro
   - OTHER + O/H = 185 kEuro => funded => 185 kEuro

   There is no limit on *OTHER* costs, but it should be noted that  they
   should not exceed in visible ways the previous limit (7% or funding).

2) FLAT RATE 20% (FR20) (sec.2b)

  The partner accounts for all direct costs and applies a flat  rate  of
  20% on o/h costs (which do not need to be reported). As far as  I  can
  gather, the funding limits are the same as in 1. The idea is that  you
  don't have analytical accounting of your o/hs and therefore decide for
  a lump sum.

3) SPECIAL TRANSITIONAL FLAT RATE (STFR) (sec.2b2)

   Only direct costs are accounted, and in this system:

   - RTD Activities are funded at a max rate of 75%
   - DEMO Activities are funded at a max rate of 50%
   - OTHER Activities are funded at a max rate of 100%

   The o/h are calculated on full *direct costs* as a 60% flat rate.
   Example:

   Partner STFR:

   - RTD direct costs 100 kEuro
   - DEMO direct costs 100 kEuro
   - OTHER direct costs 100 kEuro

   then:

   - RTD + O/H = 160 kEuro => funded => 120.00
   - DEMO + O/H = 160 kEuro => funded =>  80 kEuro
   - OTHER + O/H = 160 kEuro => funded => 160 kEuro

   Not all partners may apply for STFR; in  general,  academic  partners
   and non-profit *may* apply.


General example inserted in the document at pag.76 (I suppose  they  are
talking about a beneficiary who has adopted the Special Transition  Flat
Rate funding scheme:

EC funding of a beneficiary (university) in a  project  which  has  RTD,
demonstration and management activities with the following direct costs;

RTD costs: EUR 100,000
Demonstration costs: EUR 100,000
Management costs: EUR 100,000

Calculation of the Indirect costs:
RTD costs: EUR 100,000 x.60% = EUR 60,000
Demonstration costs: EUR 100,000 x.60% = EUR 60,000
Management costs: EUR 100,000 x60% = EUR 60,000

Reimbursement as follows using reimbursement rates against total eligible costs
RTD costs: 75% of (EUR 100,000 + EUR 60,000) = EUR 120,000
Demonstration costs: 50% of (EUR 100,000 + EUR 60,000) = EUR 80,000
Management costs: 100% of (EUR 100,000 + EUR 60,000) = EUR 160,000
Total to be reimbursed = EUR 360,000
